#Title

Information Security with HelmetJS - Disable Client-Side Caching with helmet.noCache()

#Learning Objective

Developers will identify the primary use case for helmet.noCache().

Developers will apply the helmet.noCache() in the in the provided boilerplate. 

#Key Terms

*Caching*- In computing, a cache is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere.


#Direct Instruction

If you are releasing an update for your website, and you want the users to always download the newer version, you can (try to) disable caching on clientâ€™s browser. It can be useful in development too. Caching has performance benefits, which you will lose, so only use this option when there is a real need.


#Student Practice

helmet.noCache() middleware should be mounted correctly
