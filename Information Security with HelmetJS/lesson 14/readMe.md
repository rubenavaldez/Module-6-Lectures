#Title
Information Security with HelmetJS - Hash and Compare Passwords Synchronously

#Learning Objective
Developers will be able to define synchronous hashing

#Key Terms
synchronous- concurrent in time

#Direct Instruction
Hashing synchronously is just as easy to do but can cause lag if using it server side with a high cost or with hashing done very often. 

#Student Practice
Group Discussion

#Demonstration of Learning
Developers will discuss synchronous hashing in a group setting.
